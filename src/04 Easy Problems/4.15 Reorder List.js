// The inPlace() function first finds the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer approach. Then, it disconnects the first half from the second half and reverses the second half. Finally, it merges the first half and the reversed second half alternately.

// The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list, as it iterates through the list twice (once to find the middle and once to merge the two halves). The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the new dummy node.
