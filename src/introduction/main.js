// A Linked List is a Linear Data Structure which means that there is a continous contigence relationship between
// the members of the datastructure. A Linked List doesn't use memory allocation to enforce contigence unlike an array.
// The members of a linked list can be stored in random spaces in memory but relies on neighbour pointers to enforce contigence
// of members. The List has two special pointers (Head, Tail), which reference the begining and end of the list respectively.
// This then means the access is Linear from a Head node to the Tail Node. And the basic type of Linked List is one without any
// members. We'd represent this by the Head and Tail nodes all pointing at null. In this state the list is considered empty.
